Two events:
I have an event taylor swift concert that has three tickets available.
I have an nfl event that has 5 tickets.

Users should be able to book tickets but not if they already booked a ticket for that event.
They should also not be able more tickets than the available ones.

If I have a list of events book two tickets for taylor swift concert.
